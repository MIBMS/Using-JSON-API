# Using-JSON-API
Importing a typical JSON script and using the Google Geocode API that uses JSON

json parse.py:

The program will prompt for a URL, read the JSON data from that URL using urllib and then parse and extract the comment counts from the JSON data, compute the sum of the numbers in the file.


geojson api.py:

In this program you will use a GeoLocation lookup API modelled after the Google API to look up some universities and parse the returned data.
